This is an incomplete clone of the Power Grid board game.

It currently reaches Phase 4 (Building) and doesn't do anything else.  You
can't actually play a game.  But it's neat, and there's a (small) chance that
I implemented a lot of features but ignored this README.  You have been warned.

Runtime requirements:
    o pygame
        - Graphics, somehow contained so that logic is separate, but leaks here
          and there.

Build time requirements:
    o ImageMagick
        - Used to convert svg to png.
